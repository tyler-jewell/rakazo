# Self-hosting Rakazo

The signed-in product is a long-running API, a Graphile Worker, Postgres, and a computer provider (Docker supervisor or E2B). It is not a static site.

## Local (source checkout)

Same as the README quick start: `.env` from `.env.example`, Postgres via Compose, `pnpm sandbox:build`, `pnpm dev`, then [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

## Docker Compose (single machine)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to long random strings. Rakazo refuses placeholder or missing secrets outside `development` / `test` (or when `RAKAZO_ALLOW_DEV_SECRETS=1` is set).
2. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (and `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` if you want Plugins).
3. Build the computer image: `pnpm sandbox:build` (Compose also builds it via the `computer` service).
4. `docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up --build`
5. Open the web origin (`http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default). The first registered user becomes the deployment owner.

Compose runs Postgres, the sandbox supervisor (Docker socket), API, worker, and a Vite preview of the web app. Bot computers are sibling containers (`rakazo/computer:local`). The API process does not get an unrestricted Docker socket; the supervisor owns lifecycle.

Postgres is published on **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1:5433` on the host). Do not expose that port on a public VPS. Change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and keep Postgres on an internal network when you deploy remotely.

The Docker supervisor is not published. It is authenticated and stays on the internal Compose network because access to it is equivalent to control of the Docker host. It uses `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` as its shared service credential by default; advanced deployments can set the same independent `SANDBOX_SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` value on the API, worker, and supervisor.

On a VPS, put TLS in front of `:5173` (or serve the web build behind your proxy) and set:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://app.example.com
WEB_ORIGIN=https://app.example.com
API_URL=https://app.example.com
```

Cookies and CORS follow those origins. Keep `SIGNUPS_ENABLED` / `SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` tight on a public host.

Optional:

```env
SIGNUPS_ENABLED=true
SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST=you@example.com,@company.com
SANDBOX_PROVIDER=docker   # or e2b. Keep fake only for pnpm test.
AGENT_RUNTIME=pi          # Keep scripted only for pnpm test.
WAKEUP_DRIVER=graphile
SANDBOX_IDLE_MS=600000    # pause the bot computer after 10 minutes idle
SANDBOX_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS=300000 # stop a shell command after 5 minutes
E2B_API_KEY=              # when SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b
```

Do not commit `.env`. Never put `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, OpenRouter keys, or provider tokens in git, logs, or chat.

## Choosing a computer provider

The signed-in web app is the only client of the API. Docker and E2B still apply. `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=desktop` is a separate, explicit provider that always runs commands on the service host.

- **Docker** is the default for local use and the quickest self-hosted setup. Workspace bots share a persistent Team Computer by default; Private computers are optional. Keep the supervisor private, as the included Compose file does.
- **E2B** runs bot computers away from the Rakazo host and is the recommended choice for public or multi-user production deployments. Rakazo checkpoints the portable workspace and browser-profile directory to `DATA_DIR`; the E2B disk is a runtime cache, not the durable source of truth.
- **Desktop provider** runs commands on the API/worker host when you set `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=desktop`. Bots can use working directories under the process user's home folder. Do not enable it on a public or shared service.
- **Fake** is only an emulator for verification.

## Backup

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

This dumps Postgres (`pg_dump`) and archives `data/` into `backups/<stamp>/`.

## Public single-VM deployment

`infra/compose/docker-compose.prod.yml` runs the hosted product with Postgres, the API, worker, web app,
and automatic HTTPS through Caddy. It uses E2B for bot computers, so the VM never exposes a Docker
supervisor or browser containers.

Before deploying to a new Ubuntu host, create and verify a key-only `deploy` account, then apply the
idempotent host-hardening baseline. It disables SSH passwords and root login, rate-limits SSH, allows
only SSH/HTTP/HTTPS through UFW, enables fail2ban, unattended security updates, AppArmor, audit rules,
and conservative kernel/network protections. Keep the provider console open until a fresh SSH login
succeeds after the script reloads SSH.

```bash
sudo DEPLOY_USER=deploy bash infra/compose/harden-host.sh
```

The production host also uses `infra/compose/docker-daemon.json` to enable live restore, bounded local
container logs, default no-new-privileges, and the kernel NAT path instead of Docker's userland proxy.

1. Point an `A`/`AAAA` record such as `app.example.com` at the VM and allow inbound TCP 80/443 and
   UDP 443. If you use Cloudflare, enable the proxy with **Full (strict)** TLS and copy
   `Caddyfile.cloudflare.example` to an operator-controlled path outside the public checkout. Set
   `CADDYFILE_PATH` to that absolute path. The example drops application requests that do not come
   from Cloudflare's [published IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/); reconcile those ranges
   whenever Cloudflare publishes a change. A Cloudflare Tunnel can replace the public web listeners.
2. Clone the repository on the VM and create a root `.env` with production-only values. At minimum set
   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `E2B_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
   `RAKAZO_HOST`, and the three public origins. Use URL-safe random values for database credentials.
3. Keep registration allowlisted while the service is private:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
RAKAZO_HOST=app.example.com
# Optional operator-owned override, for example the Cloudflare allowlist file:
# CADDYFILE_PATH=/etc/rakazo/Caddyfile.prod
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://app.example.com
WEB_ORIGIN=https://app.example.com
API_URL=https://app.example.com
SIGNUPS_ENABLED=true
SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST=owner@example.com,reviewer@example.com
SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b
AGENT_RUNTIME=pi
WAKEUP_DRIVER=graphile
DATA_DIR=/data
```

4. Start the stack and verify its public health endpoint:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
curl --fail https://app.example.com/health
```

The root `.env` is excluded from both Git and the Docker build context. The database, application data,
and Caddy certificates live in named Docker volumes.

For the single-VM production layout, install `infra/compose/backup-prod.sh` as
`/usr/local/sbin/rakazo-backup` and enable the supplied `rakazo-backup.timer`. It creates a verified
Postgres custom-format dump plus an application-data archive under `/var/backups/rakazo`, with mode
`0600` and seven-day rotation. These local snapshots help with operator mistakes but are not a
substitute for an encrypted off-host backup or provider snapshot.

## Restore

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh backups/<stamp>
```

## Upgrade

Pull the new source, run `pnpm --filter @rakazo/db migrate`, then restart API and worker. Product contracts stay compatible across cloud and self-hosted.

## What “Rakazo Cloud” still needs

The product cannot be “pushed live” as a Vercel serverless app. Graphile Worker, Postgres `LISTEN`, Pi runs, and Docker computers need durable processes and a sandbox host.

To run a hosted product (same codebase):

1. Push `main` (this checkout may be ahead of GitHub).
2. Provision managed Postgres 16 and run `pnpm db:migrate`.
3. Run **API** and **worker** as always-on Node 22 services (Fly machines, a VM, ECS, k8s). Not lambda-style request handlers.
4. Persist and back up `DATA_DIR` (bot homes, browser profiles, artifacts). Today the concrete store is a local filesystem (`LocalAgentHomeStore`), so attach a Rakazo-owned durable volume shared by API and worker processes. The storage contract is separate from the computer-provider contract, but an object-storage implementation is not wired yet.
5. Choose computers: **`SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b`** with `E2B_API_KEY` for a public or multi-user production service. Each Team or Private Computer reconnects to its sandbox id (`providerRef`), while workspace state is checkpointed outside E2B at run completion, explicit stop, and idle suspension. If that sandbox is gone—or the deployment changes providers—the replacement is hydrated from Rakazo's copy. Idle boxes pause after `SANDBOX_IDLE_MS` (default 10 minutes) and resume on the next message or Take control. Docker remains the local and trusted single-machine default.
6. A Hetzner CX22 (2 vCPU / 4 GB) is enough for API + worker + Postgres when E2B owns the desktops. 2 GB works for a quiet box; 8 GB is only needed if you also run Docker computers on that same machine.
7. Set public HTTPS `WEB_ORIGIN` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `API_URL`, secrets, and an OpenRouter (or other Pi) deployment key if you want to skip per-user model keys.
8. Put the web app behind the same origin as `/api` and `/rpc` (Vite preview proxy, or a reverse proxy). Docker noVNC connections use short-lived signed `/novnc/*` capabilities; do not replace that route with an unrestricted port proxy.
9. Turn on `SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` until you want open registration. There is no Rakazo-managed model billing in version 1 — users bring keys.

The signed-in web app is a PWA of that origin. It is not a Cloud control plane.
