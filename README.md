# Rakazo

![Rakazo — AI teammates you actually own](./docs/readme-hero.png)

Open-source Grok Bot alternative, built with Cursor and Grok 4.6.

Installable web app (PWA) and macOS desktop. Bring your own AI and sandbox. The product is still early (beta).

Each bot has one thread, one computer, memory, routines, and history. A bot can also spawn more bots — each a regular peer with its own thread and computer — or run short-lived subagents inside the current turn. This repository is the complete core product — it runs without a Rakazo-operated control plane.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccdeddb-2134-4a56-8eed-b2e591736b1c

## Stack

- TypeScript
- React 19, Vite, Tailwind
- Electron (macOS)
- Hono, oRPC
- Postgres, Prisma
- Better Auth
- Graphile Worker
- Pi
- Any sandbox provider (tested with Docker and E2B)
- Composio

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 9
- Docker Desktop (Postgres plus the graphical bot computer)

## Run locally (web)

From the repo root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

- Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to long random strings before any network exposure. Placeholder values only work in local `development` / `test` runs.
- Put your OpenRouter key in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or skip the key and paste one during onboarding).
- ChatGPT Plus or Pro, GitHub Copilot, or SuperGrok / X Premium: skip the key and sign in on the **Connect a model** screen. Pick **OpenAI Codex**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **xAI**, then sign in with the device code Pi shows. Claude Pro is not in the Rakazo UI yet — Pi's Claude login opens a localhost callback, which does not work from the web app.
- Optional: `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` if you want Plugins to talk to live apps.

Then:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up postgres -d
pnpm install
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm sandbox:build
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the API (`:3100`), Graphile Worker, Vite web app (`:5173`), and sandbox supervisor (`:7091`).

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173). Sign up, pick a model from the Pi catalog (paste an API key, sign in with ChatGPT / Copilot / SuperGrok, or Skip if the deployment key is set), create a bot, send a message. The computer pane is a live Linux desktop. The model can observe and control the screen, use browsers and other graphical applications, run terminal commands, and work with files. You can interact with the same desktop while it runs; taking control makes the viewer editable but does not impose an exclusive agent/user lock. Ask a bot to spawn another bot, or to run a subagent for work that should stay inside this turn.

Confirm the product path:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3100/health
```

You want `"runtime":"pi"`, `"sandbox":"docker"`, `"jobs":"graphile"`, and `"realtime":"postgres"`. `"composio":true` only if the Composio key is set.

Product defaults are Pi + Docker + Graphile. `pnpm test` pins the emulators (`AGENT_RUNTIME=scripted`, `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=fake`, `WAKEUP_DRIVER=memory`) so default tests never call live models or Composio.

### Computer and app modes

The app you open and the computer provider are separate choices. The PWA web app and the macOS Electron app are clients of the same API. Docker stays the default. In the Electron app the deployment owner is asked once whether bots should keep using Docker or run on this Mac as you.

| `SANDBOX_PROVIDER` | Where agent commands run | Best fit | Isolation notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docker` (default) | A Docker computer on your machine. The Electron app can switch this to This Mac without changing the env var. | Quick local setup and trusted single-machine self-hosting | Workspace bots share the Team Computer by default; Private computers are optional. The supervisor controls the local Docker daemon, so keep its port private; Rakazo does this by default. |
| `e2b` | A remote E2B desktop through the E2B SDK | Public or multi-user deployments | Team and Private computers are isolated from the Rakazo application host. Requires `E2B_API_KEY`. Workspace and browser-profile data are checkpointed into Rakazo-owned `DATA_DIR`, so the provider machine is not the durable source of truth. This Mac is not available. |
| `desktop` | Directly on the API/worker host. Working directories under the process user's home folder are allowed. | A trusted single-user local process | Least isolated. Model-initiated shell commands run with the Rakazo process's OS permissions. Do not use it on a public or shared server. The Electron first-run "This Mac" choice uses this provider while leaving `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=docker`. |
| `fake` | An in-process emulator | Tests only | Does not run a real computer. |

Docker remains the recommended quick start for someone running Rakazo on their own machine. E2B is the safer boundary when untrusted users or public traffic share a deployment.

If this Postgres was created with `prisma db push` before checked-in migrations existed, mark the baseline once:

```bash
pnpm --filter @rakazo/db exec prisma migrate resolve --applied 0001_init
```

## Run the desktop app

The Electron shell loads the same web UI. Leave `pnpm dev` running, then:

```bash
pnpm --filter @rakazo/desktop dev
```

Native red / yellow / green buttons close, minimize, and zoom that window. They do nothing in the browser tab. On first launch the desktop app asks whether bots should keep using Docker or run on this Mac as you. Docker stays the default. macOS will not show a permission prompt for that choice — the consent is Rakazo's.

Point Electron at a different origin with `RAKAZO_WEB_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:5173`).

Packaged installers (optional):

```bash
pnpm --filter @rakazo/desktop pack
```

Outputs land in `apps/desktop/out/` (macOS dmg/zip). Those builds still need a running API and web origin.

## Test

```bash
pnpm test              # unit, property, and in-process contract tests
pnpm test:integration  # Postgres journeys, Graphile jobs, LISTEN/NOTIFY
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright against the emulated stack
pnpm test:e2e -- --sandbox=e2b # the same deterministic suite against real E2B
pnpm test:topology     # local Docker + Graphile worker recovery (needs Docker)
pnpm test:canary       # live OpenRouter / E2B canaries
# explicit real vision-model + real E2B desktop acceptance test:
COMPUTER_E2E_MODEL=<vision-capable-openrouter-model-id> pnpm test:computer
```

Pull requests retain the Playwright HTML report, screenshots, traces, and videos as short-lived
GitHub Actions artifacts. Successful merges and the nightly verification publish a persistent run
history plus a scan-friendly screenshot gallery at
<https://rakazogithubactions.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com/playwright/index.html>.

The Playwright workflow can also be started manually with **Sandbox provider** set to `e2b`.
That option requires `E2B_API_KEY`, keeps the deterministic scripted agent runtime, and destroys
the provider machines after the run. The default and all automatic runs remain on `fake`.

`pnpm test:topology`, `pnpm test:canary`, and `pnpm test:computer` are for running the product path on your machine. They are not part of pull-request CI. The computer acceptance test also requires `E2B_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (the command reads the root `.env`) and uses a temporary Postgres container. It proves an actual model can observe and click a real browser, then use the sandbox terminal and files.

See [`docs/computer-runtime.md`](./docs/computer-runtime.md) for the agent/runtime boundary, provider switching, and persistence contract.

## Self-host and Cloud

See `docs/self-host.md`. Cloud and self-hosted editions share the same application and contracts. There is no separate Rakazo-hosted control plane in this repo yet — a public Cloud deploy is a VPS (or E2B), not a serverless push of the chat app.
